# Configure networking and hostname resolution statically or dynamically
Netplan configuration files are stored in the /etc/netplan directory. Youâ€™ll probably find one or two YAML files in this directory. The file name may differ from setup to setup. Usually, the file is named either 01-netcfg.yaml or 50-cloud-init.yaml but in your system, it may be different.
