# Configure a caching DNS server
DNS is a distributed, hierarchical key-value database. 

## Training
* [Linux Academy](https://linuxacademy.com/cp/courses/lesson/course/5415/lesson/1/module/428)

## Record Types
* A (Address Mapping Records)
* AAAA (IP Version 6 Address Records)
* CNAME (Canonical Name Records)
* MX (Mail Exchanger Records)
* NS (Nameserver Records)
* PTR (Reverse-Lookup Pointer Records)
* SOA (Start of Authority Records)
* TXT (Text Records)

## Forward DNS
Forward DNS queries use A or AAAA record types and are most often used to turn a DNS name into an IP address.

## Forward DNS
Forward DNS queries use A or AAAA record types and are most often used to turn a DNS name into an IP address.

## Reverse DNS
It's used to turn an IP address into a DNS name.
* IPv4: `.in-addr.arpa.`
* IPv6: `.ip6.arpa.`

Example:
```
192.168.1.25 to 25.1.168.192.in-addr.arpa. - IPv4
```

## BIND9
Bind files are stored in the **/etc/bind** folder.
```
sudo apt-get install bind9
sudo systemctl start bind9​​​​​​​
```

### Configuration
Settings for the configuration file are stored in the **/etc/bind/named.conf.options**:
```
acl goodclients {
    localhost;
    192.168.0.0/24;
}

options {
        listen-on port 53 { 127.0.0.1; 192.168.0.0/24; };
		...
        allow-query        { goodclients; };
        allow-query-cache  { goodclients; };
		...
        recursion yes;
        forwarders {
                8.8.8.8;
                8.8.4.4;
        };
		...
};
````

If you do changes on the configuration. You have to restart the service.
```
sudo systemctl restart bind9​​​​​​​
```

### [named-checkconf](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man8/named-checkconf.8.html)
Use to check the configuration file for proper syntax.
