# Create, manage and diagnose advanced file system permissions

## sticky bit
Only owner or root can delete / rename contents within the directory:
````
chmod 1744 /path/folder - drwxr-xr-T
````

## setuid
Run the script with the owner privileges.
````
chmod 4744 /path/script - drwxrxsr-x
````

## setgid
* Run the script with the group owner privileges.
* If it's a directory the created files under this directory will have as a owner the group directory owner.
````
chmod 2754 /path/script - drwsr-xr-x
````

**Note**: To add multiple permissions like sticky + setgid. You have to exectute: `chmod 3770 file`

## Extended attributes
* `chattr +i file` add immutable attribute to a file. It cannot be deleted or removed
* `chattr -i file` remove immutable attribute from a file.
* `lsattr file` shows file's extended attributes
