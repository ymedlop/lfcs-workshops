    ​           The first "ALL" indicates that this rule applies to all hosts.
demo ALL=(***ALL***:ALL)      ALL
    ​           This "ALL" indicates that user demo can run commands as all users.
demo ALL=(ALL:***ALL***)      ALL
    ​           This "ALL" indicates that user demo can run commands as all groups.
demo ALL=(ALL:ALL)      ***ALL***
